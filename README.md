# Prediction-CustomerLifetimeValue-CLV

Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) is an important metric for businesses as it measures the total worth/profit from a particular customer to a business over a period of time. This metric informs business leaders on decisions regarding strategic focus on existing customer retention or new customer acquisition; marketing strategies targeted at specific segments of the populace; and recommended advertisement budget projections. This project aims to predict the CLV of customers ( based on Revenue) from 1-year transaction data (2012).

Steps Implemented:
1. data exploration 
2. creation of 18 customer level quantitative and qualitative attributes based on invoice data
3. performed variable selection
4. checked the validity of the model assumptions
5. checked performance of model on test data

Based on the performance, variable selection, and goodness of fit metrics identified, three models namely: Full-Transformed, Step-Wise-Transformed, and Lasso Transformed were found to be good candidates for the purpose.

Result: The net total revenue for the first 6 months of 2013, with 3546 customers is predicted to be $ 28.03 M with 64.8 % of the customers belong to the $0-$1000 segment.
