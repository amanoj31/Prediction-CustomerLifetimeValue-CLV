# Prediction-CustomerLifetimeValue-CLV

Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) is an important metric for businesses. CLV represents the total 
worth/profit from a particular customer to a business over a period of time. It provides a
measure of relative importance of existing customers to a business in terms of revenue, churn,
interaction, and loyalty. This metric informs business leaders on decisions regarding strategic
focus on existing customer retention or new customer acquisition; marketing strategies targeted
at specific segments of the populace; and recommended advertisement budget projections. In
short, CLV is a powerful measure of customer value to a business based on historic transaction
data; a metric which is hard to encapsulate in existing summary statistics such as total
transactions, average purchase amount per transaction, or percentage of total sales.
This project aims to predict the CLV of customers based on 1-year transaction data.
